# React exercises (mini-projects)
This repository contains different exercises / mini-projects. They allow me to learn and exercise React concepts, but also CSS.

Exercise ideas are sourced from (or inspired by) ChatGPT, blogs, YouTube videos, my friends and me.

I check each completed exercise with ChatGPT to get feedback and improvement suggestions.

## Example exercises
- Counter
- User Form
- List filtering
- Random quote generator
- Fetching user data with API
